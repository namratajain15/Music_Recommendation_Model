# Music_Recommendation_Model
Imagine we have online music store. User when sign up, we ask their age and gender and based on their profile we recommend various music albums they are likely to buy. So, we are using ML to increase sale.

In this we are using Decision Tree Algorithm. It is already implemented in a library called Scikit-Learn. DecisionTreeClassifier is a class in tree module in sklearn package that comes with Scikit-Learn library.
